# odin-testing-practice

This is an exercise solution for the
[Testing practice](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-testing-practice)
that can be found on the
[The Odin Project's JavaScript course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript).

For practice purposes, it is written in TypeScript instead of JavaScript.
